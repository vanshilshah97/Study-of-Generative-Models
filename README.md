# Study-of-Generative-Models
The project aims to compare different generative models, that utilizes encoder-decoder architectures. In this study, we fit three different models - Principal component analysis, Autoencoders and Variational autoencoders- on CIFAR 10 dataset. We perturb their latent space in three ways, and compare the image generated. During the course of the study, we found that autoencoders were able to generate a few synthetic images that were visually believable. The study concludes by comparing these models by passing the synthetic image generated through a pretrained Alexnet built for CIFAR 10 classification, and proves that the autoencoders are better in generating better synthetic images than that of PCA and the baseline
